# SONiC - SWitch State Service Common Library - SWSS-COMMON

## Description
The SWitch State Service (SWSS) common library provides libraries for database communications, netlink wrappers, and other functions needed by SWSS.

## Getting Started

### Build from Source

Checkout the source:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/sonic-swss-common


Install build dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install make libtool m4 autoconf dh-exec debhelper cmake pkg-config \
                         libhiredis-dev libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev libnl-route-3-dev swig3.0 \
                         libpython2.7-dev libgtest-dev

You can compile and install from source using:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make && sudo make install

You can also build a debian package using:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b

### Build with Google Test
1. Install Google Test DEB package.
```
$ sudo apt-get install cmake libgtest-dev
$ cd /usr/src/gtest && sudo cmake . && sudo make
```
2. Rebuild with Google Test
```
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --enable-debug 'CXXFLAGS=-O0 -g'
$ make clean
$ GCC_COLORS=1 make
```

3. Start redis server if not yet:
```
sudo sed -i 's/notify-keyspace-events ""/notify-keyspace-events AKE/' /etc/redis/redis.conf
sudo service redis-server start
```

4. Run unit test:
```
tests/tests
```

### GitHub Workflow

We're following basic GitHub Flow. If you have no idea what we're talking about, check out [GitHub's official guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Note that merge is only performed by the repository maintainer.

Guide for performing commits:

* Isolate each commit to one component/bugfix/issue/feature
* Use a standard commit message format:

>     [component/folder touched]: Description intent of your changes
>
>     [List of changes]
>
> 	  Signed-off-by: Your Name your@email.com

For example:

>     swss-common: Stabilize the ConsumerTable
>
>     * Fixing autoreconf
>     * Fixing unit-tests by adding checkers and initialize the DB before start
>     * Adding the ability to select from multiple channels
>     * Health-Monitor - The idea of the patch is that if something went wrong with the notification channel,
>       we will have the option to know about it (Query the LLEN table length).
>
>       Signed-off-by: user@dev.null
